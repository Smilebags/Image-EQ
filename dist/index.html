        <h1>Image EQ</h1>
        <p>This is the input image. You can use this or <span class="upload-prompt">use your own</span>.</p>
        <img id="imageViewer" src="Default.jpg">
        <input type="file" id="fileInput">
        <label for="fileInput" id="fileInputLabel">Choose an Image</label>

        <input type="button" id="render" value="Calculate" />

        <input type="button" id="recalculate" value="Refresh" />
        <p>This is still a work in progress, my final plan is to have an EQ style graph with controllable points in order to push/pull certain frequencies in the image. This feature isn't available in any major software so I thought I would develop it myself.</p>
        <p>This was made using standard JavaScript, including a modified version of <a href="https://antimatter15.com/2015/05/cooley-tukey-fft-dct-idct-in-under-1k-of-javascript/">Kevin Kwok's code</a> for FFT and DCT for some of the basis for the behind
            the scenes magic. It could be made significantly faster by moving the heavy calculations to the GPU or alternatively to WASM, but I don't have the math skills to do this.</p>
